"""
Abstract base class for all specialized bases.

The Basis class is meant to specify a basis of the Hilbert space of the
studied system. Besides basis specific information all subclasses must
implement a shape variable which indicates the dimension of the used
Hilbert space. For a spin 1/2 Hilbert space this would for example be the
vector Int[2]. A system composed of 2 spins could for example have a
shape vector Int[2 2].

Composite systems can be easily defined with help of the CompositeBasis class.
"""
abstract Basis


"""
An easy and fast to use general purpose basis.

Should only be used rarely since it defeats the purpose of checking that the
bases of state vectors and operators are correct for algebraic operations.
The cleaner way is to specify special bases for different systems, i.e.
there are FockBasis, MomentumBasis and PositionBasis.
